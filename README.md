## How it works
As a normal calculator, but every time you push a number, the whole board changes, just to make life harder. Oh and also, the result you get might not be correct.

## Give it a try!
If you have an Android device, you can download the APK [right here](https://cntr.click/XW3y9G0). 
If you have an iPhone, you just can't lol.
You can also clone this repo like this:

```
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/samuelmarina/useles-calculator.git
$ cd useless-calculator
```

And then just run it
```
# Install required packages
$ yarn install || npm install

# Run Expo
$ expo start

# Press a for Android emulator, or i for iOS simulator
# Or run it in your device using the other Expo options (e.g. QR code)
```

This project is made to be part of my series called "Useless Apps", not meant to be serious, but just useless. They're fun, but probably they don't work too well.
